                    My journey with Condor airlines was a pleasant one. I took the chance to teach myself a new skill, many developers don't even think or know about it. Condor part of the Thomas Cook Group is offering a service of public airline booking. In the UK and US it is a law to meet the standard of WCAG level AA for those systems. When this rule got released the booking engine and website needed to be enhanced for people with disabilities till the end of 2015(US) and 2016(UK).

                    Before starting of wildly improving usability, we needed a tool to measure the current state and every incremental improvement to reach the goal as fast as possible. We asked a third party service to provide us with reports after every major release and our self, used browser tools and screen readers to test our changes. A big part of the changes had been made in the use of correct context tags, i.e. using buttons instead of links for submitting forms, or ordering headlines h3 cannot come before h2. We added new elements, i.e. skip links and close buttons for layers. And improved tags with aria attributes to describe the seat and prices.

                    The changes we made till here are usability improvements for screen-readers, other people with a visual disability and using normal screens seeing mostly fewer colours. The visual designer needed to come up with a new high contrast theme. green changed to orange, white text on coloured background changed to gray. The blue turned out darker and active elements needing a highlighted border. The UK and US website using the normal plus a layer for visual improvements. No worries SCSS and JS are optimized in the build for UK and US to eliminate overhead.
