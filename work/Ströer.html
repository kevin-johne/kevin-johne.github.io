                    I started working on Ströer OMS in the need of a new calendar. Which is representing schedules for billboards as a yearly and monthly view. OMS is an internal management platform for maintenance of Ströer billboards. Which consist out of a complex infrastructure. Myself was working mainly on the frontend. Templates were written in Struts a Java template engine and modules on the page were written in AngularJS. Data was retrieved from an API with ajax calls. The API is managed by Struts schema which is mapped to Java methods
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The app has several interactive elements: toggle events, display other months and years, showing the daily schedule and printing... Of course. After the calendar, I have been continuing working for Ströeer for platform maintenance.
