                    In cooperation with Jacques' IT at denkwerk we made a mobile website of the already existing desktop website. It was a challenge for the UX team to transfer all the features of the desktop website to a mobile context. In the frontend department ware developing static templates, which got integrated by Jacques' IT in a later state. It is only possible to visit this project from a mobile phone or chrome dev tools with mobile mode on.
