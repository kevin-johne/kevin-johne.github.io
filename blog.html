    <h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>
        Can it be that a section for blog entries is on of the basic requirements for an developer web page?
        So I have it here, but till now I couldn't get my keyboard around to write up a story upon a past project, plugin, or an idea.

        Someday there will be something to read. The positive phrase, coming soon ...
