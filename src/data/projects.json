As global definitions we specified general configuration which everything is based on later, containing i.e. font families, font sizes, colours, grid, indents, breakpoints, margins, and animation time functions. The beauty of these configurations is the possibility to alter the whole theme within seconds. That's how we created the Carolus brand site, only by changing colour, font families and other settings.",

Not closing the submenu accidentally by hovering over another main menu entry when the mouse is one the way to a sub menu entry diagonally placed to its parent. Preventing this is usually solved with a time out which activates on leaving a main item. it solves the problem for fast user with a fast movement.
